# Classic C programs

This repo. contains a few useful C codes that may be necessary for handling neuronal (biological) spike data 

This repository is created with an aim to develop a C-based toolbox for computational neuroscience. The focus is mainly for decoding of spike-data. It is a *lame* project and wish it would be get done within 5 years with strong functionality. We sometimes make use of GNU libraries <https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/> and user-defined functions. As for as this repository is concerned we strictly do not use C++

If you are interested, please feel free to *pull*, *commit*, *stage* and *merge*!
