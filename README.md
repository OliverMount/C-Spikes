# Classic C progrms


This repo. contains a few useful C codes that may be necessary for most of the enginnering applications. 

This repository is created with an aim to develop a C-based toolbox for computational neuroscience. The focus is mainly for decoding of spike-data. 

It is a lame project and wish it would be get done within 5 years with strong functionality. 

If you are interested, please feel free to *pull*, *commit*, *stage* and *merge*! 

## Steps in making a tool-box 
1. Find out the basic data types needed
2. Create a new data type using C struct, if necessary
3. Make use of GNU libraries <https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/> and user-defined functions
